for model to database 
1. startup project must be the model of which project
we want 
2. deafult project in the console must be the your project 
3. command 
add-migration meaningfullname

to push these changes to database 
4. update database 
Configure Services 
It basically tell the applicatio about the services which we are using in our applications 


what is DTOs?
What is automapper ?

DTOS
Problems without DTOs
Decouple client from internal implementation (as it may directky hit the database)
Hide propertites that clients are not supposed to view (internal property should not be visible)
Avoid "over-posting "vulnerbilities (client shlould not send any useless data to our database)


problem can we solve as adding extra service layer that is
DTOs 
Controller will take DTOs as input and output as DTOs

basically DTO holds the property that must be visible 
publically 



Automapper
Means we are mappinf DTOs to internal main object that bind to database 
services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(AutoMapperProfiles).Assembly);

inject in conteoller construtor 
construtor(IMapper mapper)
mapper.map<destination >(source); to map



Task ??
ctor tabtab for constructor
